This is my submission for the WorkHuman Technical Challenge:

I used DjangoRest API for backend and coded the backend in python. I populated the database using python3 manage.py shell
Start the backend api by running 
    python3 manage.py runserver

I used React for the frontend using react-bootstrap for styling. Frontend is coded using javascript.
