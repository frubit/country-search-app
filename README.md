This is my submission for the WorkHuman Technical Challenge:

I used DjangoRestFramwork for backend and coded the backend in python. 
It contains one module Country and I populated the database using python3 manage.py shell.
Start the backend api by running 
    python3 manage.py runserver

I used React for the frontend using react-bootstrap for styling. Frontend is coded using javascript.
If cloning the repository run npm install to get required node modules.
